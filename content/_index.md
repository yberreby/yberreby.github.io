Hi! I'm @yberreby, a researcher, engineer, and technophile.

These days, I'm a PhD student at McGill University and Mila, jointly supervised by Prof. Suresh Krishna and Prof. Audrey Durand.

My technical interests include, non-exhaustively:

- Hardware design / low-level programming
- Functional programming
- Compiler design
- Math
- AI/ML
- Computational neuroscience & biology
- [Proof assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant)

I was deep into cybersecurity for a few years, winning a few French competitions and ranking well in a few more, but it is no longer a core interest of mine - at least not on the offensive side.

Language-wise, I'm a big fan of Rust and OCaml, a heavy Python user for AI/ML, and I've been meaning to get into Julia. I also have background in C, C++, SystemVerilog (a [HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language), for the uninitiated), JavaScript/TypeScript (both client and server), and dabbled in many more languages to varying extents.

Want to chat? You can [reach me via email](mailto:me@yberreby.com), or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yberreby/).

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yberreby/) and [Mastodon](https://masto.ai/).
