Hi! I'm Yohaï-Eliel Berreby (@yberreby), a researcher, engineer, and technophile.

## Research

These days, I'm a PhD student at McGill University and Mila, jointly supervised by Prof. Suresh Krishna and Prof. Audrey Durand.
My research is currently focused on the intersection of AI neuroscience. How can the brain teach us to build better AI, and how can we use AI to understand the brain better?

## A few things I've done

I've won [hackathons](/hackathons) (co)organized and/or sponsored by [Optiver](https://optiver.com/), [Meta AI](https://www.meta.ai/), [SCOR](https://www.scor.com/en), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), [l'X](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), [Wavestone](https://www.wavestone.com/en/).
I've also made podium in hackathons organized by [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/), [Orange Cyberdefense](https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/), and others.

I was the 6th employee of the [YC startup Routine](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/routine), which I joined in 2021 as an OCaml backend software engineer.
I spearheaded efforts that made it possible for Routine to use the same OCaml codebase on iOS and on other platforms, with fully-automated, type-safe Swift <-> C <-> OCaml interoperability, and cross-compilation of OCaml code to `aarch64-apple-ios`.

Before that, I worked as an network and infrastructure engineering apprentice at [C2S Bouygues](https://www.c2s-bouygues.com/).
In the year I spent there, I automated the majority of the daily integrity checks in an IT infrastructure supporting the Bouygues Group's 80,000+ employees, designed, developed and deployed an internal data integration platform that cut down friction in inter-department operations within C2S, and worked on mission-critical infrastructure for the [OnDijon](https://www.c2s-bouygues.com/2021/06/02/smart-city-le-commencement-ondijon/) smart city.

I hold a _Diplôme d'Ingénieur_ from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), where I specialized in embedded systems (bare-metal and low-level software, FPGA/ASIC hardware programming with SystemVerilog).
