I grew up on Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X.
The UNIX backbone of Mac OS X made it a great introduction to computing, but it ultimately proved unacceptably limiting for my purposes.
As a result, since 2015-2016, I've been a faithful (Arch) Linux user. I've run Arch on a trusty [Asus Zenbook UX410U](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/zenbook-ux410/), two custom-built desktops, many VMs, two consecutive Tuxedo Pulse 15 laptops from [Tuxedo Computers](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/), an Asus TUF A15, and a few other devices.

From day one, I've embraced the Arch spirit, consistently running either [i3](https://i3wm.org/) or [sway](https://swaywm.org/) as my tiling window managers of choice, complete with a panel of shortcuts allowing me to get much of my computer use done at the speed of thought.

Over the years, a number of friends and coworkers have adopted similar setups, in search of a streamlined yet ruthlessly efficient system configuration.

Arch is an _excellent_ distro.
This whole time, it's been difficult for me to imagine using anything else.
Occasionally having to use a Mac or Windows PC seemed like a test of patience; Arch felt like _home_.
A computing environment that I trust, that I understand, built by and for me, sculpted according to my precise needs, changing by my will and not due to some tech company's idea of what's good for me ("hey, it's 2025, we should [make everything unreadable!](https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/)").

Damn, I'm getting nostalgic just writing this.

A few weeks ago, I caved in and bought a [14" M4 Pro MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-m4), which I intend to keep it running macOS.
Would running Linux on it be an option? I certainly considered it. Unfortunately, the excellent [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/) project only appears to deliver good support up until M2 chips, with [support for M4 Pro remaining entirely inadequate](https://asahilinux.org/docs/platform/feature-support/m4/).

This decision was shocking to nearly everyone around me.
